Q: What's the advantage to buying OCI's Distribution of TAO?

A: >
 Depending
 upon your circumstances, there may be several advantages to buying OCI's
 Distribtution of TAO rather than closely tracking the beta source code kits:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>Stability</b>: OCI's Distribution of TAO is based on a stable, tested, and
 supported release of TAO.  If you need a solid, consistent version of
 TAO on which to base your product or project, this is the one for you.
 If you need to stay abreast of new research directions or want to try
 out the latest features, you can still obtain TAO beta kits in source
 code form by visiting <a href="http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/</a>.<br>
 <li> <b>Time Savings</b>: Rather
 than downloading source code and building it yourself, OCI can provide prebuilt binaries for your specific platform,
 as part of our professional services.  This can save you
 many hours of work.  We regularly build and test across several platforms, operating systems, and
 compilers, in several different configurations, so we are well positioned to help you with your specific build.<br>
 <li> <b>Documentation</b>: Using OCI's Distribution of TAO is easy with OCI's <em>TAO Developer's Guide</em>, available for
 complimentary download from  <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/products/tao">https://objectcomputing.com/products/tao</a>.
 In addition to the documentation set, the latest release notes are available directly in the source code distribution
 in $ACE_ROOT/OCIReleaseNotes.html.<br>
 <li> <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>: OCI maintains a list of frequently asked questions about TAO.  This
 list is updated regularly by our staff of distributed object computing
 technology engineers to provide answers to common questions about
 using TAO.  Anyone in the TAO user community can contribute questions
 (and answers) to the FAQ.  Check it first to see if your question has
 been asked before.  The FAQ is located at <a href="https://objectcomputing.github.io/OCITAO/support/faq.html">https://objectcomputing.github.io/OCITAO/support/faq.html</a><br>
 <li> <b>Professional Support</b>: If you need further support, beyond installation issues or frequently
 asked questions, such as object technology training, consulting,
 mentoring, or application development, OCI has several service
 offerings for you.  Visit <a href="http://www.objectcomputing.com/">http://www.objectcomputing.com</a> for more information.
